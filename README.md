# ArkhamMaps

Alright, welcome to the readme.  This here is the random generator for arkham's maps.  The interface sucks, but that's because I put literally no effort into it whatsoever.  This is just something to test algorithms so we can create the best random Arkham possible.

To use it, you might have to use both mouse and keyboard at different steps of the way.  I'm not sure how to get this forked yet, but it's up.  We'll work on forking it now.

Good luck.
